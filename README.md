# Coding-And-Programming-WAU

This is the Wauconda, Illinois submission for the FBLA Coding and Programming challenge.

In the project file there will be one file named code and another named FEC Manager.
The Code file contains all the source code python files to view code in an editor.
The other folder is where the executable version is. The exe is called FEC Manager.exe and can be used to view the application.
